\section{Differentiating Functions of Several Variables}
\subsection{The Partial Derivative}
\qs{Elementry Estimation of Two Variable Functions}{Imagine an unevenly heated thin rectangular metal plate lying in the $x y$-plane with its lower left corner at the origin and $x$ and $y$ measured in meters. The temperature (in ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) at the point $(x, y)$ is $T(x, y)$. See Figure 14.2 and Table 14.2 . How does $T$ vary near the point $(2,1)$ ?
\imgg{q1}{0.7}
}
\sol We have two directions, such that we go left/right and up/down.
\\ Therefore, we define two functions of one variable.
$$ u(x) = T(x, 1) \quad \text{also} \quad v(y) = T(2, y)$$
Such that:
$$ u'(2) = \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{u(2+h)-u(2)}{h} = \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{T(2+h, 1)-T(2, 1)}{h} $$
$$ \approx \frac{T(3,1) - T(2,1)}{3-2} = \frac{160 - 135}{1} = 25 $$
\newline
$$ v'(1) = \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{v(1+h)-v(1)}{h} = \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{T(2, 1 + h)-T(2, 1)}{h}$$
$$ \approx \frac{T(2,2) - T(2,1)}{2-1} = \frac{120 - 135}{1} = -15 $$

\dfn{Partial Derivatives of $f$ With Respect to $x$ and $y$}{For all points at which the limits exist, we define the partial derivatives at the point $(a, b)$ by
$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_x(a, b)=\text { Rate of change of } f \text { with respect to } x \text { at }(a, b)=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h, b)-f(a, b)}{h}, \\
& f_y(a, b)=\text { Rate of change of } f \text { with respect to } y \text { at }(a, b)=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a, b+h)-f(a, b)}{h} .
\end{aligned}
$$
If we let $a$ and $b$ vary, we have the partial derivative functions $f_x(x, y)$ and $f_y(x, y)$.
\double Simply, we find the derivative of the cross section of the function with respect to the variable we are taking the partial derivative of.
\triple
If $z=f(x, y)$, we can write
$$
f_x(x, y)=\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \quad \text { and } \quad f_y(x, y)=\frac{\partial z}{\partial y},
$$
$$
f_x(a, b)=\left.\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right|_{(a, b)} \quad \text { and } \quad f_y(a, b)=\left.\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right|_{(a, b)} .
$$

The quantity, $Q$, of beef purchased at a store, in kilograms per week, is a function of the price of beef, $b$, and the price of chicken, $c$, both in dollars per kilogram.
\\(a) Do you expect $\partial Q / \partial b$ to be positive or negative? Explain.
\\(b) Do you expect $\partial Q / \partial c$ to be positive or negative? Explain.
\\(c) Interpret the statement $\partial Q / \partial b=-213$ in terms of quantity of beef purchased.}
\sol
\\(a) Keep c constant, increase b, Q increases. The higher the beef prices, the lower purchase quantity. Therefore $\partial Q / \partial b$ is negative.
\\(b) Keep b constant, increase c, Q increases. The higher the chicken prices, the higher purchase quantity of beef. Therefore $\partial Q / \partial c$ is positive.
\\(c) If the price of beef increases by 1 dollar per kilogram, the quantity of beef purchased decreases by 213 kilograms per week.

\double
b) Simplify $z$ such that anything non $x$ is constant: $z = \frac{1}{2ay} x^{-2} + \frac{3abc}{y} x^5$

\subsection{Local Linearity and the Differential}
Recall for functions of one variable, if the function is differentiable at a point, "nearby" that point, the curve acts almost like its tangent line. So the curve values can be approximated using the tangent line (the curve's linearization), provided we stay close to that point.
\imgg{14.3slope}{0.6}
Where the point is $(a, f(a))$ and the slope $= m = f'(a)$ such that $y-y_1 = m(x-x_1) \implies y = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$
For functions of two variables, we have a similar situation.

\subsection{Gradients and Direction Derivatives in Space}

\\ As a result the directional derivatie becomes
$$ f_{\vec{u}} (a,b,c) = \nabla f \cdot \vec{u} = f_x (a.b,c) u_1 + f_y (a,b,c) u_2 +f_z (a,b,c) u_3$$

\\So $y$ is a function of $x$ and $x$ is a function of $t$, so ultimately $y$ is a function of $t$. When there is a change in $t$ that will cause a change in $x$ and the change in $x$ will cause a change in $y$.
\double
And $\frac{d y}{d t}= \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dx}{dt}$

\\We use local linearity to figure this out.
\double We know
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\Delta x }{\Delta t} &= \frac{dx}{dt} \implies \Delta x = \frac{dx}{dt} \Delta t\\
  \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} &= \frac{dy}{dt} \implies \Delta y = \frac{dy}{dt} \Delta t

\double Also recall the critical points of $f(x)$, where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x)$ DNE.
\\ However, a critical point does not guarantee a local extrema.

$z^2 = 9-xy-3x \implies d = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+ 9-xy-3x}$ \\

We preform the second derivative test, $f_{xx} = 2 > 0 \quad f_{yy} = 2 \quad f_{xy} = -1 \quad D = 3 > 0$ \\
Therefore, since $f$ is a parabaloid as $x,y \to \infty \implies f \to \infty$ we have a global minimum at $(2,1)$ \\

$\lambda x = \lambda 2y \implies x=2y$ and $x^2+y^2=5 \implies y = \pm 1$. \\
Our points are $(2,1)$ and $(-2,-1)$ \\

\section{Integrating Functions of Several Variables}
\subsection{The Definite Integral of a Function of Two Variables}
\dfn{Double Integral}{
Suppose the function $f$ is continuous on $R$, the rectangle $a \leq x \leq b, c \leq y \leq d$. If $\left(u_{i j}, v_{i j}\right)$ is any point in the $\ddot{j}$-th subrectangle, we define the definite integral of $f$ over $R$
$$ \int_R f d A=\lim _{\Delta x, \Delta y \rightarrow 0} \sum_{i, j} f\left(u_{i j}, v_{i j}\right) \Delta x \Delta y . $$
The case when $R$ is not rectangular is considered. Sometimes we think of $d A$ as being the area of an infinitesimal rectangle of length $d x$ and height $d y$, so that $d A=d x d y$. Then we use the notation
$$ \int_R f d A=\int_R f(x, y) d x d y = \iint_R f(x,y) dx dy $$
For this definition, we used a particular type of Riemann sum with equal-sized rectangular subdivisions. In a general Riemann sum, the subdivisions do not all have to be the same size.
}
\ex{Interpretation of the Double Integral as Volume}{
  As the number of subdivisions grows, the tops of the bars approximate the surface better, and the volume of the bars gets closer to the volume under the graph of the function

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Volume under graph } \\
& \text { of } f \text { above region } R
\end{aligned}=\int_R f d A .
$$
}
\ex{Interpretation of the Double Integral as Area}{
In the special case that $f(x, y)=1$ for all points $(x, y)$ in the region $R$, each term in the Riemann sum is of the form $1 \cdot \Delta A=\Delta A$ and the double integral gives the area of the region $R$ :
$$ \operatorname{Area}(R)=\int_R 1 d A=\int_R d A $$
}
\newpage
\ex{Interpretation of the Double Integral as Average Value}{
As in the one-variable case, the definite integral can be used to define the average value of a function:
$$\begin{gathered}\text { Average value of } f \\ \text { on the region } R\end{gathered}=\frac{1}{\text { Area of } R} \int_R f d A$$
\\ We can rewrite this as
$$ \text { Average value } \times \text { Area of } R=\int_R f d A $$
If we interpret the integral as the volume under the graph of $f$, then we can think of the average value of $f$ as the height of the box with the same volume that is on the same base.

\ex{Integrating a triangle horizontally and vertically}{
  The density at the point $(x, y)$ of a triangular metal plate, is $\delta(x, y)$. Express its mass as an iterated integral.\\
  The vertical strip that starts at the point $(x, 0)$ ends at the point $(x, 2-2 x)$, because the top edge of the triangle is the line $y=2-2 x$. See Figure 16.16. On this vertical strip, $y$ goes from o to $2-2 x$. Hence, the inside integral is
  $$ \int_0^{2-2 x} \delta(x, y) d y $$
  Finally, since there is a vertical strip for each $x$ between 0 and 1 , the outside integral goes from $x=0$ to $x=1$. Thus, the iterated integral we want is
  $$ \text { Mass }=\int_0^1 \int_0^{2-2 x} \delta(x, y) d y d x $$
  \imgg{ex16.4.1}{0.635}
  We could have chosen to integrate in the opposite order, keeping $y$ fixed in the inner integral instead of $x$. The limits are formed by looking at horizontal strips instead of vertical ones, and expressing the $x$-values at the end points in terms of $y$. To find the right endpoint of the strip, we use the equation of the top edge of the triangle in the form $x=1-\frac{1}{2} y$. Thus, a horizontal strip goes from $x=0$ to $x=1-\frac{1}{2} y$. Since there is a strip for every $y$ from o to 2 , the iterated integral is

\ex{Interpretation of Triple Integrals as Infentesimal Boxes times $f$}{
First we subdivide $W$ into smaller regions, then we multiply the volume of each region by a value of the function in that region, and then we add the results. For example, if $W$ is the box $a \leq x \leq b, c \leq y \leq d, p \leq z \leq q$, then we subdivide each side into $n, m$, and $l$ pieces, thereby chopping $W$ into $n m l$ smaller boxes.

The volume of each smaller box is
$$ \Delta V=\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z $$
where $\Delta x=(b-a) / n$, and $\Delta y=(d-c) / m$, and $\Delta z=(q-p) / l$. Using this subdivision, we pick a point $\left(u_{i j k}, v_{i j k}, w_{i j k}\right)$ in the $i j k$-th small box and construct a Riemann sum

\subsection{Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates}
\dfn{Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates}{
  A rectangular grid is constructed from vertical and horizontal lines of the form $x=k$ (a constant) and $y=l$ (another constant). In polar coordinates, $r=k$ gives a circle of radius $k$ centered at the origin and $\theta=l$ gives a ray emanating from the origin (at angle $l$ with the $x$-axis). A polar grid is built out of these circles and rays. Suppose we want to integrate $f(r, \theta)$ over the region $R$ below
  \imgg{ex16.6.1}{0.5}
  Choosing $\left(r_{i j}, \theta_{i j}\right)$ in the $\ddot{j}$-th bent rectangle above gives a Riemann sum:
  $$ \sum_{i, j} f\left(r_{i j}, \theta_{i j}\right) \Delta A . $$

If $\Delta r$ and $\Delta \theta$ are small, the shaded region is approximately a rectangle with sides $r \Delta \theta$ and $\Delta r$, so
$$ \Delta A \approx r \Delta \theta \Delta r $$

Thus, the Riemann sum is approximately
$$ \sum_{i, j} f\left(r_{i j}, \theta_{i j}\right) r_{i j} \Delta \theta \Delta r $$

If we take the limit as $\Delta r$ and $\Delta \theta$ approach o, we obtain
$$ \int_R f d A=\int_\alpha^\beta \int_a^b f(r, \theta) r d r d \theta $$
\imgg{ex16.6.2}{0.5}
